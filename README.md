TODO: 
- make loading notification while it's still waiting for API responses just so player knows
- BETTER QUERYING!!!!!!!!!!!!
    - rn the issue is it grabs ANY time control, I limited it to top 4 moves but we should use some percentage, so if >80% of moves are in the first x number, choose random move from those or something like that, etc., so this could be easy fix
- make it so board oriented where whoever's move it is is on bottom (i.e. black to play means black on bottom as if you're playing black)
