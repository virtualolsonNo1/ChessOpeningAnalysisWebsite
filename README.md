TODO: 
- make loading notification while it's still waiting for API responses just so player knows
- BETTER QUERYING!!!!!!!!!!!!
    - rn the issue is it grabs ANY time control, I limited it to top 4 moves but we should use some percentage, so if >80% of moves are in the first x number, choose random move from those or something like that, etc., so this could be easy fix
- fix bug where after loading best moves from api, if displaying new opening or hit generate new opening, displays results anyway
- fix board orientation to simply match opening
- Add in arrows for best moves
